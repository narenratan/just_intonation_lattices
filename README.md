# Just intonation lattices

Given a list of frequency ratios, draw a graph of their just intonation lattice.

The lattice is represented as a directed graph
- Nodes are frequency ratios
- Two frequencies are connected if they are related by multiplying or dividing by a single prime number (ignoring powers of two)
- The graph is drawn in two dimensions
- Edges are colored to show which prime is used to move between nodes
